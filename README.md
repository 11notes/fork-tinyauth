# Tinyauth - The easiest way to secure your traefik apps with a login screen

Tinyauth is an extremely simple traefik forward auth proxy that adds a login screen to all of your apps that are using the traefik reverse proxy. Tinyauth is configurable through environment variables and it is only 20MB in size.

## Screenshots

Talk is cheap, here are some screenshots:

## Getting started

Tinyauth is extremely easy to run since it's shipped as a docker container. I chose to bundle it with busybox so as you can easily debug the API (e.g. using curl) and have some simple linux tools. If you want to get started with an example just check the example docker compose file [here](./docker-compose.example.yml)

## Environment variables

Tinyauth accepts the following environment variables:

| Name       | Description                                             | Default | Required |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `PORT`     | The port the API listens on.                            | 3000    | no       |
| `ADDRESS`  | The address the API binds on.                           | 0.0.0.0 | no       |
| `SECRET`   | A 32 character long string used for the sessions.       | -       | yes      |
| `ROOT_URL` | The base URL of your domain. (e.g. https://example.com) | -       | yes      |
| `APP_URL`  | The Tinyauth URL. (e.g. https://tinyauth.example.com)   | -       | yes      |
| `USERS`    | Comma seperated list of `user:bcrypt-password-hash`.    | -       | yes      |

## FAQ

### Why?

Why make this project? Well we all know that more powerful alternatives like authentik and authelia exist but when I tried to use them I felt overwhelmed with all the configration options and environment variables I had to configure in order for them to work, so, I decided to make a small alternative in Go to both test my skills and cover my simple login screen needs.

### Is this secure?

Probably, the sessions are managed with the gin sessions package so it should be very secure. It is definitely not made for production but it could easily serve as a simple login screen to all of your homelab apps.

### Do I need to login every time?

No, when you login tinyauth sets a `tinyauth` cookie in your browser that applies to all of the subdomains of the root URL you set.
